🔧 Steps to Push Your Existing Spring Boot Project to GitHub
1. Create a new repo on GitHub
Go to GitHub.
Click New Repository.
Give it a name (e.g., springboot-demo).
Leave it empty (don’t add README, .gitignore, or license — you can do it later).
Copy the repo URL (HTTPS or SSH, e.g. https://github.com/yourname/springboot-demo.git).

2. Initialize Git inside your IntelliJ project folder
Open a terminal inside your project’s root directory and run:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Spring Boot project"

3. Link to your GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/springboot-demo.git

4. Push your code
git branch -M main   # rename current branch to main (optional, GitHub default is main)
git push -u origin main

5. Verify
Refresh your GitHub repo page — your full Spring Boot project should now be there 🎉.

There is no tracking information for the current branch. Please specify which branch you want to merge with. See git-pull(1) for details.
git pull <remote> <branch> If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with: git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> main

Ahh yes 👍 this is a classic first–push issue when your local branch and the remote branch aren’t linked yet.
Here’s what’s happening:
You created a repo on GitHub → GitHub made a default branch (main).
Locally, you also have a branch (probably master or main) but it’s not tracking the remote branch.
That’s why Git is telling you to set tracking info.

✅ How to Fix (Clean Way)
1. If your local branch name is main
Run:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
git pull --rebase origin main
Then push:
git push -u origin main

----------------------------------------------------------------------

git push -u origin main

🔎 Parts of the command
git push
Pushes commits from your local branch to a remote branch.
In other words: take my local code and update the remote repo.

origin
This is the name of the remote repository.
When you run
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/repo.git
you tell Git “call this GitHub repo origin”.
So here, you’re pushing to your GitHub repo named origin.

main
This is the branch name you’re pushing.
Means “push my local main branch to the main branch on remote origin”.

-u (or --set-upstream)
This sets up a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.
After running this once, you can just type:
git push
git pull
without needing to specify origin main every time.
Git will remember: my local main branch tracks origin/main.

✅ In simple terms
git push -u origin main

means:
➡️ “Push my local main branch to the main branch on the remote repo origin,
and remember this link so I don’t have to type the branch name every time.”

problem :- PS D:\Nodejs\NodeLearningProject> git pull origin fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
— happens when your local repo and the remote repo on GitHub have different,
unrelated histories (e.g., you initialized both separately using git init).
solutions:-
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
